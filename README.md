# Welcome to UpCourse project!

## About
UpCourse app is the final project for Software Development Academy's Java course.

The idea is simple - it's a training management system application where users can manage educational courses based on their user role. 

There are 3 roles: ADMIN, TEACHER, STUDENT.
Students and teachers have a convenient way to check their schedules. 
Admins can create and change courses, register students and teachers to the courses.

Other features include:
 - logging in with JWT authentication
 - registering as a new user with the default role as student,
 - admin can search users by username
 - and change student-teacher roles,
 - editing profile information,
 - reseting password

Upcourse is running on Spring Boot, Angular and MySQL.
